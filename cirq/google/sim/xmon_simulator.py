"""XmonSimulator for the Google's Xmon class quantum computers.

The simulator can be used to run all of a Circuit or to step through the
simulation Moment by Moment. The simulator requires that all gates used in
the circuit are either native to the xmon architecture (i.e. cause
`cirq.google.is_native_xmon_op` to return true) or else can be decomposed into
such operations (by being composite or having a known unitary). Measurement
gates must all have unique string keys.

A simple example:
    circuit = Circuit([Moment([X(q1), X(q2)]), Moment([CZ(q1, q2)])])
    sim = XmonSimulator()
    results = sim.run(circuit)

Note that there are two types of methods for the simulator.  "Run" methods
mimic what the quantum hardware provides, and, for example, do not give
access to the wave function.  "Simulate" methods give access to the wave
function, i.e. one can retrieve the final wave function from the simulation
via.
