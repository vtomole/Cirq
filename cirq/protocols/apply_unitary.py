        This method is given both the target tensor and workspace of the same

        write specialized simulation methods that run without performing large
        allocations, significantly increasing simulation performance.

        The target may represent a wave function, a unitary matrix, or some

                (and in fact expected) to mutate `args.target_tensor` and
