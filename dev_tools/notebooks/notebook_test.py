# ========================== CONTINUOUS NOTEBOOK TESTS ============================================
#
# These tests are run for all of our notebooks against the current branch. It is assumed that
# notebooks will not install cirq in case cirq is on the path. The simple `import cirq` path is the
# main focus and it is executed in a shared virtual environment for the notebooks. Thus, these
# tests ensure that notebooks are still working with the latest version of cirq.
