    Uses the Deferred Measurement Principle to move all measurements to the
    end of the circuit. All non-terminal measurements are changed to

    operations are transformed to quantum controls from those ancilla qubits.
    Finally, measurements of all ancilla qubits are appended to the end of the

    Optimizing deferred measurements is an area of active research, and future
    iterations may contain optimizations that reduce the number of ancilla
